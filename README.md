# Special-SVG-Logos

## Description
In this project, we were asked to build an SVG Logo Maker where a user answers a series of questions that will then render in the file that is auto generated by this app. The main task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a logo file in SVG format from a user’s input using the Inquirer package. In my application, the auto generated logo/SVG file will be created in the root directory.

It's installed with the latest Jest library to test the JavaScript by running npm install –save-dev jest. The shapes.spec.js file imports the shape classes from the shapes.js module and defines the test suite for the shape class. The test checks if each shape object can be displayed correctly by calling the render method and comparing the result to an expected SVG string.

## Usage
To use the application, the steps are:
Clone the Repo
Install the latest jest, and inquirer.
Run node index.js in your terminal
Answer all 4 questions
The logo.svg file will be generated

## Test 
In the terminal, type npm test

## User Story
```
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered


```
